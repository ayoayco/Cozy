About a year ago, I briefly wrote [about Cozy on my personal blog](https://ayos.blog/building-a-cozy-web). I typically aim to do that every time I have a new hobby project to describe the motivations and enumerate the different tech that went into its creation.

At the time, Cozy was just another fun weekend project I built as I played around some web development techniques that were new to me. I listed some libraries I used, like [@extractus/article-extractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@extractus/article-extractor) and [Astro](https://astro.build), and vaguely mentioned the process that happens when you use the web app.

Since then, I've been using Cozy almost every time I read an article online. I have come to love the feeling of control, privacy, and ownership it gives -- something we have lost in almost all "modern" online experiences nowadays.

You visit a news website, for example, and you just know the content are mostly just a bait 


Browsers are not helping. AI

Having a web page let's me skip all the noise that plague almost all modern websites


[Astro's on-demand rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/) and [JavaScript's Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache)

The goal for this site is to have a place where I publish about the new features of the [web app](/) and the web development techniques used to achieve them.
