# Contributing to Cozy

Thank you for your interest in building the coziest web experience for people like you and me.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with the following tech
1. TypeScript, HTML, SCSS - even just knowing basic JS and CSS will give you familiarity of the code
1. [Astro](https://astro.build) - Astro is the chosen framework, please read throught the basics on their docs if you are unfamiliar
 - we don't use any framework that ships to the browser, we only write Astro components for server-side rendering, and vanilla DOM manipulation via `script` tags.
1. [@extractus/article-extractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@extractus/article-extractor) - Article Extractor is the library we use to fetch and extract article content
