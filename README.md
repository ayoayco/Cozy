Store all your favorite online articles for safe-keeping. That's it. That's the app.

## Usage / Options

**1. Copy, Paste**

It's simple. When you open an article and want to turn it into a more cozy reading experience, just copy the url and paste it to the cozy app's address bar.

*Oh, you're too lazy for that?*

**2. One-click Bookmark**

A bookmarklet could run a script to open the current page for you on Cozy. You can create this new bookmark titled 'Get cozy!' and put the following as value for the URL:

```
javascript:(function(){ window.open('https://cozy-reader.netlify.app/?url=%27 + window.location.href, %27_self%27); })();
```

This is possible on all major browsers, including Safari on iOS (where I personally use this often). Some screenshots:

*Oh, you don't want a bookmark?*

**3. One-click Extension then...**

It doesn't exist yet... I'll probably get to creating a browser extension at some point. Either that, or I'll write a CONTRIBUTING.md and PRs will be welcome.
