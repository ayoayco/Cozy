Store all your favorite online articles for safe-keeping. That's it. That's the app.

## Usage - Copy, Paste

It's simple. When you open an article and want to turn it into a more cozy reading experience, just copy the url and paste it to the cozy app's address bar.

## Oh, you're too lazy for that? - One-click Bookmark

You can create a new bookmark titled 'Get cozy!' and put the following as value for the URL:

```
javascript:(function(){ window.open('https://cozy-reader.netlify.app/?url=%27 + window.location.href, %27_self%27); })();
```

## You don't want a bookmark? - One-click Extension then...

It doesn't exist yet... I'll probably get to creating a browser extension at some point. Either that, or I'll write a CONTRIBUTING.md and PRs will be welcome.
